                            <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> The best venue/entertainment combo is a private home or estate where you have dinner catered or delivered (7-8pm), followed by your entertainment performance around 9-10pm, then after-party at the same location. This creates a seamless, stress-free evening where everything happens in one place.
