                        <h3>ü•Ç Start with Beach Brunch Perfection</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Because every great bach weekend starts with bottomless mimosas and ocean views.</p>
                        
                        <p>Mount Pleasant's proximity to the beach means you get the best of both worlds: legit brunch spots with killer food AND those Instagrammable waterfront views. Hit up a restaurant with outdoor seating near the marsh or waterway, where you can toast the bride-to-be while dolphins literally swim by. (Yes, really!)</p>
                        
                        <p>Look for spots offering bottomless brunch packages‚Äîyour wallet and your squad will thank you. Most places serve until 2-3pm on weekends, so you can sleep in after your travel day and still catch brunch. Order the shrimp and grits (you're in the Lowcountry, after all), snap a million group photos, and get the weekend started right.</p>
                        
                        <div class="insider-tip">
                            <strong>üî• Insider Tip:</strong> Make reservations at least 2-3 weeks in advance for larger groups, especially during peak season (April-October). Tell them it's a bachelorette party when you book‚Äîsome places might add special touches like a champagne toast or reserved seating with the best views!

                        <h3>‚õµ Cruise Shem Creek Like the Locals</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Shem Creek is THE Mount Pleasant experience‚Äîand it's absolutely perfect for bachelorette parties.</p>
                        
                        <p>This historic creek is lined with amazing restaurants, bars, and boat docks where you can charter everything from sunset cruises to full-blown party boats. Picture this: your entire crew on a private boat, cruising past working shrimp boats, dolphin pods playing in the wake, beers in hand, and the golden hour sun making everything look magical. That's a Shem Creek cruise.</p>
                        
                        <p>You've got options here. Book a sunset cruise for romantic vibes and incredible photo ops (the Charleston Harbor sunset hits different). Or go for a daytime dolphin-watching tour if your group wants a more laid-back vibe. Some charters even let you bring your own coolers, so you can stock up on the bride's favorite drinks and keep costs reasonable.</p>
                        
                        <p>Not into boats? No problem! The Shem Creek boardwalk is lined with waterfront restaurants and bars where you can post up on a dock-side patio, order fresh seafood, and watch the boats come and go. It's quintessential Lowcountry and absolutely not to be missed.</p>
                        
                        <div class="insider-tip">
                            <strong>üî• Insider Tip:</strong> Book your boat charter for the early evening (around 5-6pm) to catch the sunset, then head straight to the Shem Creek restaurant scene afterward. You'll be energized from the cruise and ready to keep the party going. Pro move: coordinating matching outfits (white linen shirts, bride sash) makes for incredible photos on the boat!

            <!-- Activity 3: Rooftop Bars -->
            <div class="row mb-5">
                <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto">
                    <div class="activity-card">
                        <div class="activity-number">3</div>
                        <h3>üç∏ Hit the Rooftop Bar Scene</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Because nothing says "bachelorette party" like cocktails with a view.</p>
                        
                        <p>Mount Pleasant and nearby Charleston are absolutely stacked with incredible rooftop bars, and they're perfect for your bach weekend vibes. We're talking craft cocktails, panoramic views of the harbor and city skyline, and that elevated (literally) atmosphere that makes everyone feel fancy.</p>
                        
                        <p>Start your rooftop crawl in the late afternoon around 4-5pm to catch happy hour specials, then work your way through 2-3 spots as the evening progresses. The vibe shifts from "sophisticated cocktails in the golden hour" to "let's dance on this rooftop" as the night goes on, and it's the perfect energy for a bachelorette group.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dress code tip: Most rooftop bars have a "nice casual" dress code, so save the matching "Bride's Babes" tanks for daytime activities and go for sundresses, rompers, or cute tops with jeans for the rooftop scene. Pack a light jacket too‚Äîit gets breezy up there as the sun goes down!</p>
                        
                        <div class="insider-tip">
                            <strong>üî• Insider Tip:</strong> Don't try to visit more than 3 rooftop bars in one night. Quality over quantity! Pick your favorites, spend an hour or so at each, and actually enjoy the experience instead of rushing. And always, ALWAYS arrange your rideshare before you start drinking‚Äîsurge pricing is real in Mount Pleasant on weekend nights.

                        <h3>üèñÔ∏è Soak Up the Beach Life</h3>
                        <p class="lead">You're minutes from some of South Carolina's best beaches‚Äîuse them!</p>
                        
                        <p>Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island are both less than 15 minutes from Mount Pleasant proper, and they're exactly the kind of beaches that make for perfect bachelorette memories. Rent a beach house if you can swing it, or just pack up coolers, beach chairs, and plenty of sunscreen for a day trip.</p>
                        
                        <p>The vibes? Chill and fun without the crazy crowds you'd find at tourist trap beaches. You can set up your little bach party camp with a canopy, blast a playlist from a portable speaker (respectfully), play drinking games in the sand, and take a million photos with matching beach towels or floaties.</p>
                        
                        <p>Want to elevate it? Book a beach setup service that brings luxury chairs, umbrellas, and even a floating bar to your spot. Show up, claim your Instagram-worthy beach setup, and spend the day floating, sunning, and celebrating the bride. Chef's kiss.</p>
                        
                        <div class="insider-tip">
                            <strong>üî• Insider Tip:</strong> Hit the beach in the morning (9-11am) to snag the best spots before it gets crowded and hot. Bring a cooler with ros√©, White Claws, and water (hydration is key!), plus snacks. And don't forget to take the classic "jumping in the air" group photo‚Äîit's a bachelorette requirement!

                        <h3>üíÜ Pamper Session: Shopping & Spa Day</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Every bride deserves to be pampered, and Mount Pleasant has the spots to make it happen.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dedicate one afternoon to pure indulgence. Start with a group mani-pedi session at a local salon‚Äîmany offer packages for bridal parties where you can all get pampered together while sipping champagne. It's the perfect low-key activity where you can catch up, gossip, and get wedding planning updates from the bride.</p>
                        
                        <p>After nails, hit the boutique shopping scene. Mount Pleasant has adorable local shops where you can find unique gifts for the bride (or yourself‚Äîno judgment). Think cute jewelry, home decor for her future married life, or matching "Mrs." and "Wifey" gear if that's your vibe.</p>
                        
                        <p>If your group wants to go all out, book a spa afternoon with massages, facials, or even a mobile spa service that comes to your rental house. Nothing says "we love you" like arranging for the bride to get a couples massage before the wedding (even if it's with her favorite bridesmaid for now).</p>
                        
                        <div class="insider-tip">
                            <strong>üî• Insider Tip:</strong> Schedule spa appointments for mid-afternoon (2-4pm) on your second day. This gives everyone time to recover from the previous night's activities and creates a nice buffer before evening plans. Plus, you'll all look fresh and camera-ready for dinner!

                        <p class="lead" style="color: white;">Here's where your Mount Pleasant bach weekend goes from amazing to absolutely legendary.</p>
                        
                        <p>After a day of brunching, cruising, and beach vibes, there's one activity that'll become THE story everyone tells about this trip: bringing in private entertainment at your rental house or hotel suite. We're talking about hiring a professional male entertainer like Michael from Sexy Muscle Men to deliver a show that'll have everyone screaming, laughing, and creating memories that last way longer than the wedding itself.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 30px;">Why In-Home Entertainment is Perfect for Bach Parties:</h4>
                        
                        <p><strong style="color: white;">Privacy & Comfort:</strong> Unlike crowded clubs or public venues, having entertainment come to your rental means the show is just for your group. No strangers watching, no uncomfortable bar scene, just your closest friends celebrating the bride in a comfortable, private setting where everyone can fully let loose.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong style="color: white;">Pairs Perfectly with Dinner & Cocktails:</strong> Here's the move that separates good maids of honor from legendary ones: order dinner delivery or have it catered to your place around 7-8pm. Everyone gets dressed up, enjoys a nice meal with wine, and then‚Äîsurprise!‚Äîthe entertainment arrives around 9-10pm when everyone is perfectly relaxed and ready for the main event. It's seamless, sophisticated, and absolutely unforgettable.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong style="color: white;">Professional Quality:</strong> Michael isn't some random amateur‚Äîhe brings Las Vegas-style choreography, professional showmanship, and years of experience performing for bachelorette parties. Think Magic Mike meets personal, intimate entertainment designed specifically for your group. He knows how to make the bride feel special while keeping everyone engaged and entertained.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong style="color: white;">The Photos & Videos:</strong> This is content gold. The photos and videos from a private entertainment session become the most-viewed, most-shared, most-talked-about content from the entire weekend. Years from now, when the bride is married with kids, these will be the photos that make her crack up and feel grateful for her wild, wonderful friends.</p>
                        
                        <h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 30px;">How to Plan the Perfect Evening:</h4>
                        
                        <ol style="color: white;">
                            <li><strong>Book early:</strong> Contact Sexy Muscle Men as soon as you lock down your Mount Pleasant dates. Popular weekends fill up fast!</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep it secret (if possible):</strong> Coordinate with a couple bridesmaids to surprise the bride. The element of surprise makes it even better.</li>
                            <li><strong>Set the stage:</strong> Have music ready, clear some space in your rental's main room, and make sure everyone's phones are charged for photos and videos.</li>
                            <li><strong>Timing is everything:</strong> Schedule the performance for 9-10pm, after dinner and drinks but before anyone gets too tired. This is the night's peak moment.</li>

Friday arrival and rooftop bars, Saturday beach and Shem Creek followed by in-home entertainment, Sunday recovery brunch. This pacing means everyone is relaxed, bonded, and ready for the main event when it arrives. Plus, you're not rushing around trying to get to a club or venue‚Äîthe entertainment comes to you, making the whole evening stress-free and focused on celebrating the bride.</p>

                    <div class="activity-card">
                        <h4>üöó Transportation</h4>
                        <p>Download Uber and Lyft before you arrive. Weekend nights can have surge pricing, so budget accordingly or consider renting a large van/SUV for the weekend to transport your whole crew. Some local companies offer party bus rentals for bigger groups‚Äîfun for a rooftop bar crawl!</p>

                    <div class="activity-card">
                        <h4>üè† Where to Stay</h4>
                        <p>Rent a beach house or large Airbnb/VRBO in Mount Pleasant or on Isle of Palms. Having your own space is clutch for bachelorette parties‚Äîyou can make as much noise as you want, host your own entertainment (hint hint), and save money on food by cooking some meals together. Plus, group photos in a cute beach house? *Chef's kiss.*</p>

                    <div class="activity-card">
                        <h4>üí∞ Budget Planning</h4>
                        <p>Mount Pleasant can be done on various budgets. Expect to spend $500-800 per person for a weekend including accommodations, food, drinks, activities, and entertainment. Splitting costs for the bride is traditional, so factor that in. Pro tip: Create a group Venmo or use Splitwise to track shared expenses‚Äîit prevents awkwardness later.</p>

                    <div class="activity-card">
                        <h4>üìÖ Best Time to Visit</h4>
                        <p>April-May and September-October are perfect‚Äîwarm enough for beach activities but not brutally hot or crowded. Summer (June-August) is peak season with higher prices and more tourists, but you get long beach days. Winter is surprisingly mild and way cheaper, but some beach activities might be limited.</p>

                        <h4>üëó What to Pack</h4>
                        <p>Bring: matching bach party outfits for photos, swimsuits, sundresses for rooftop bars, cute pajamas for the rental house, sunscreen (seriously, the Southern sun is no joke), a portable phone charger, and any decorations or props you want for photos. Don't forget bride accessories like a sash, veil, or crown!</p>
