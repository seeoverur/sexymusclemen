                        <p>When reaching out to book an entertainer, provide clear information about your event:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Date, time, and location of your event</li>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">Ask Questions Upfront</h5>
                        <p>Don't be shy about asking questions! Professional entertainers expect and welcome questions such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"What's included in the performance?"</li>
                            <li>"How much space do you need?"</li>
                            <li>"What should we do to prepare?"</li>
                            <li>"Can we customize any aspects of the show?"</li>
                            <li>"What are your payment terms?"</li>
                            <li>"What's your cancellation policy?"</li>

                        <h5 class="mt-4">Understand Pricing</h5>
                        <p>Professional entertainment has set pricing based on experience, performance duration, travel, and other factors. The quoted price typically includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The performance itself</li>
                            <li>Travel to your location</li>
                            <li>Professional costume(s)</li>

                            <li><strong>Good lighting:</strong> Ensure the space is well-lit (performers often bring their own accent lighting)</li>
