                        <h3>What You Need to Know About Airbnb Rules</h3>
                        
                        <p>Airbnb has implemented specific policies regarding parties and events at properties. Here's what you need to understand:</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Airbnb's Party Ban (What It Really Means)</h4>
                        <p>In 2022, Airbnb implemented a global ban on "disruptive parties and events." However, it's important to understand what this actually prohibits:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Prohibited:</strong> Large, open-invite parties with many guests beyond the booking capacity</li>
                            <li><strong>Prohibited:</strong> Unauthorized commercial events or parties advertised publicly</li>
                            <li><strong>Prohibited:</strong> Events that disturb neighbors or violate local noise ordinances</li>
                            <li><strong>Prohibited:</strong> Parties that damage property or violate house rules</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">What IS Allowed</h4>
                        <p>Small gatherings that comply with the property's occupancy limits, respect house rules, and don't disturb neighbors are generally acceptable. This includes:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intimate celebrations with your booked group (bachelorette parties, birthday dinners)</li>
                            <li>Small gatherings within the stated guest capacity</li>
                            <li>Private entertainment for your booked party</li>
                            <li>Celebrations that maintain reasonable noise levels</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="tip-box">
                            <strong>üí° Key Takeaway:</strong> A private bachelorette party with 8-12 of your closest friends, staying at the property you booked, with hired entertainment like a <a href="#">professional male dancer</a>, is NOT what Airbnb's party ban targets. You're not throwing an open party‚Äîyou're hosting a private celebration for your booked guests.

                        <h3>Noise Ordinances & Neighborhood Rules</h3>
                        
                        <p>Mount Pleasant, like most communities, has noise ordinances designed to maintain quality of life for residents. Understanding these rules helps you plan responsibly.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Quiet Hours</h4>
                        <p>Mount Pleasant typically enforces quiet hours during late night and early morning periods. While specific times can vary by neighborhood:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>General quiet hours:</strong> 10pm - 7am on weekdays, 11pm - 8am on weekends (verify current local ordinances)</li>
                            <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Keep noise at reasonable levels during these hours</li>
                            <li><strong>Outdoor noise:</strong> Be especially mindful of outdoor noise (music, voices) that carries to neighbors</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">Short-Term Rental Regulations</h4>
                        <p>Mount Pleasant has specific regulations for short-term rentals that you should be aware of:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Properties must be properly licensed as short-term rentals</li>
                            <li>Occupancy limits are strictly enforced</li>
                            <li>Parking restrictions may apply (no street blocking)</li>
                            <li>Guests are expected to respect residential neighborhood character</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="success-box">
                            <strong>‚úì Good News for Private Entertainment:</strong> Having a professional entertainer like Michael perform inside your rental at 9-10pm is well within compliance. It's indoor entertainment during reasonable hours with your booked guests‚Äîexactly the kind of responsible use that doesn't trigger complaints or violations.

                        <p>Before you even book, thoroughly review the property listing for any mention of parties, events, or gatherings.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Maximum occupancy number</li>
                                <li>Any explicit "no parties" or "no events" language</li>
                                <li>Noise policies mentioned in house rules</li>
                                <li>Guest policies (can you have visitors who aren't staying overnight?)</li>
                                <li>Any mention of security cameras or noise monitoring devices</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p><strong>Red flags to avoid:</strong> Properties that explicitly state "absolutely no parties or events of any kind" or have reviews mentioning strict enforcement. Look for properties that are more accommodating or don't mention parties at all.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Step 2 -->
                    <div class="guide-card mb-4">
                        <h3><span class="step-number">2</span>Communicate with Your Host</h3>
                        <p>Honest, upfront communication is your best tool. Before booking (or immediately after), message the host about your plans.</p>
                        
                        <h5>What to Say:</h5>

We're planning to have dinner at the house one evening and may hire private entertainment (a professional performer) for about an hour around 9pm.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns!"</em></p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> You're being transparent, emphasizing the small, private nature of your gathering, mentioning the professional aspect of entertainment, and showing respect for their property. Most hosts appreciate this level of communication.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Step 3 -->

                        <h3><span class="step-number">3</span>Book Accommodation That Fits Your Needs</h3>
                        <p>Choose a property that actually accommodates your group comfortably and supports your plans.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Ideal Property Features:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Appropriate size:</strong> Book for your actual guest count, not the maximum occupancy</li>
                            <li><strong>Good layout:</strong> Open living areas work well for entertainment</li>
                            <li><strong>Some privacy:</strong> Properties with distance from neighbors are ideal</li>
                            <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Adequate parking for your group</li>
                            <li><strong>Beach houses or stand-alone homes:</strong> Often more accommodating than condos or townhomes</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Properties in beach areas (Isle of Palms, Sullivan's Island) or stand-alone homes in Mount Pleasant often have more flexibility than properties in dense residential neighborhoods or condo buildings.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Indoor performance:</strong> Entertainment happens inside your rental, not disturbing neighbors</li>
                            <li><strong>Short duration:</strong> Typically 20-45 minutes, not an all-night event</li>
                            <li><strong>Controlled guest list:</strong> Only your booked group is present</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional setup:</strong> <a href="#">Performers like Michael</a> bring their own music setup and require minimal space</li>
                            <li><strong>Reasonable timing:</strong> Scheduled for evening hours (9-10pm) before quiet hours</li>
                            <li><strong>Respectful service:</strong> Professional entertainers understand rental property etiquette</li>
